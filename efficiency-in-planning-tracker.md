# Lesson Planning Time & Effectiveness Tracker

## Overview
This document is used to track and evaluate the time spent on lesson planning after applying the Pareto Principle, Occam's Razor, and the Pomodoro Technique.

Use this file each week to record your observations, compare them to previous weeks, and adjust your approach accordingly.

## Metrics & Evaluation

### 1. **Total Hours Spent on Lesson Planning**
   - **Purpose**: Track how many total hours you are spending on lesson planning each week.
   - **How to Use**: Record the total time spent on lesson planning each week. Compare the current week with your baseline time (before you started applying Pareto, Occam’s Razor, and Pomodoro). 

---

### 2. **Time Spent on Key Tasks**
   Break down your time into key tasks involved in lesson planning. Track how much time you're spending on each area.

   #### Tasks:
   - **Creating Lesson Objectives (Obj)**: Time spent defining lesson objectives.
   - **Writing/Curating Materials (Mat)**: Time spent creating, gathering, or refining instructional materials (slides, handouts, code examples).
   - **Designing Assessments (Assess)**: Time spent creating quizzes, assignments, or project rubrics.
   - **Reviewing Students' Work (Review)**: Time spent reviewing student code, assignments, or projects.
   - **General Organization/Logistics (Org)**: Time spent planning the course calendar, updating grades, etc.

   *Example Format:*
   - Week 1:  
     - Obj: 2 hours  
     - Mat: 3 hours  
     - Assess: 1 hour  
     - Review: 2 hours  
     - Org: 1 hour

   Compare the breakdown from each week to see if time spent on key tasks has decreased over time.

---

### 3. **Time Saved (vs. Baseline)**
   - **Purpose**: Quantify how much time you've saved compared to your baseline measurement.
   - **How to Use**: Subtract your baseline time from your current week’s total time. A positive number indicates time saved, while a negative number shows time spent more than the baseline. Track the difference weekly.

   *Example:*
   - Week 1 (Baseline): 15 hours  
   - Week 2 (New Approach): 12 hours  
   - Time Saved: 3 hours

---

### 4. **Student Engagement/Feedback**
   - **Purpose**: Measure how well students are responding to the lessons designed with the new approach.
   - **How to Use**: Record informal or formal feedback from students, such as their engagement during lessons, satisfaction with the pace, or how they feel about the clarity of materials. Use tools like surveys or direct feedback.
   - Example metrics might include:
     - % of students actively participating
     - % of students completing assignments on time
     - Any feedback on the clarity or helpfulness of the lessons

   *Example:*
   - Week 1: 75% student participation, feedback indicates confusion with lesson pacing.
   - Week 2: 85% student participation, feedback indicates better clarity and engagement with shorter assignments.

---

### 5. **Personal Satisfaction**
   - **Purpose**: Reflect on how satisfied you are with the new lesson planning process.
   - **How to Use**: Rate your level of satisfaction each week on a scale from 1-10 (1 being very dissatisfied, 10 being very satisfied). Consider your stress levels, whether you feel the process is sustainable, and if the lessons are easier to implement.

   *Example:*
   - Week 1: 6/10 (felt rushed and unclear about some of the lessons)
   - Week 2: 8/10 (more efficient, felt less stress during planning)

---

### 6. **Issues Encountered**
   - **Purpose**: Track any challenges you faced while using the new approach.  
   - **How to Use**: List any difficulties encountered while applying the principles (e.g., Pareto leading you to overlook minor concepts, Pomodoro breaking your flow). This will help you refine the process for the next week.

   *Example:*
   - Week 1: Struggled with Pomodoro breaks disrupting my train of thought during coding lessons.
   - Week 2: Found it challenging to simplify assessments without reducing rigor.

---

## Notes & Adjustments for Next Week

At the end of each week, make notes on any adjustments you want to make for the following week. Consider the following:
- Did Pareto help focus your efforts? If not, which areas can you focus on more efficiently?
- Was Occam’s Razor effective? Were there areas where you over-simplified?
- Did the Pomodoro Technique work for lesson planning? Would longer blocks of time or different break intervals work better?
- Did student feedback suggest areas where you could refine your process?

---

## Example Summary (Week 2)

- **Time Saved**: 3 hours saved compared to Week 1, mainly due to more focused lesson objectives and simpler materials.
- **Student Engagement**: Increased by 10% (more students participating and completing assignments on time).
- **Personal Satisfaction**: Rating increased to 8/10 due to feeling more organized and less stressed.
- **Issues**: Difficulty with simplifying coding exercises without losing depth. Will consider revising lesson plans for next week to ensure depth without complexity.
- **Adjustments**: Try using a longer Pomodoro interval for materials preparation (45 minutes work, 10 minutes break).

## Weekly Progress Summary

| Week | Total Time Saved | Effectiveness Score (1-10) | Major Improvements | Next Steps |
|------|------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|------------|
| 1    | 0 hours          | 5                          | N/A                | No changes yet. |
| 2    | 3 hours          | 8                          | Simplified materials | Adjust Pomodoro technique. |
| 3    | TBD              | TBD                        | TBD                | TBD        |

### How to Use This Template:
1. **Track weekly**: Each week, fill in the table with data on time spent, time saved, and feedback on your lesson planning process.
2. **Adjust your approach**: Use the “Notes & Adjustments” section to brainstorm improvements based on your results.
3. **Evaluate long-term trends**: After several weeks, look for patterns:  Are you consistently saving time? Is your lesson quality improving? Are students learning more and understanding the material better than before?

This structured approach should give you both the quantitative and qualitative data you need to determine if your new approach to lesson planning is actually effective and efficient!
