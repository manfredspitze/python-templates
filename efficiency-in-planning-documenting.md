To determine whether your new approach to lesson planning is actually saving you time, you'll want to set up a process that allows you to track and measure the time you spend on lesson planning, and then evaluate the effect of each principle (Pareto Principle, Occam’s Razor, Pomodoro Technique) individually and in combination. 

### Key Metrics to Track:
To quantify your time savings and effectiveness, here are some key metrics you might want to track weekly:
   - **Total hours spent on lesson planning**
   - **Time per task (objectives, materials, assignments, etc.)**
   - **Student feedback** (engagement, satisfaction with lessons)
   - **Your personal satisfaction with the lesson planning process**

Here’s how you can go about it:

### 1. **Track Time Spent on Lesson Planning (Baseline Measurement)**
   Before diving into the new methods, you need a baseline for comparison. For one week (or ideally two), track the amount of time you spend on each task related to lesson planning. You can break it down by specific tasks like:
   - **Creating lesson objectives**
   - **Writing/curating materials (e.g., slides, coding exercises)**
   - **Designing assessments (quizzes, assignments)**
   - **Reviewing students' work**
   - **General organization and logistics (e.g., course calendar, grading plans)**

   You can use a simple time-tracking app or even a spreadsheet to record how much time you spend on each of these tasks throughout the week.

### 2. **Apply the Principles to the Lesson Planning Process**
   Once you have a baseline, start incorporating the principles into your lesson planning:
   
   - **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)**: Focus on identifying the 20% of content or tasks that contribute to 80% of student learning and engagement. In programming, this could mean identifying the most important concepts or coding patterns that your students need to understand, and ensuring you spend the majority of your time on these key concepts.
     - Example: If you’re teaching object-oriented programming, spending more time on concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism could have a greater impact than focusing too much on more niche topics.
   
   - **Occam’s Razor**: Simplify lesson design by removing unnecessary complexity. For each lesson, consider if there’s a simpler, more efficient way to achieve the same goal. Instead of creating overly complex assignments or materials, focus on the most straightforward way to teach the concept.
     - Example: Could you use a simple code example or exercise to illustrate a key concept rather than an elaborate multi-step project?

   - **Pomodoro Technique**: Use the Pomodoro technique (work for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break) to maintain focus and productivity during your lesson planning time. This technique encourages short bursts of high-efficiency work, which can help prevent burnout and keep you from spending too much time on any one task.
     - Example: Set a Pomodoro timer while you’re writing lesson plans or preparing assignments, so you stay focused and limit distractions.

### 3. **Track Time Spent After Implementing New Approach**
   After you start applying these principles to your planning, continue tracking your time in the same way as before. For each task, note how much time you spend on it now that you've adjusted your process with the Pareto Principle, Occam’s Razor, and the Pomodoro Technique. 

### 4. **Compare the Results**
   After a couple of weeks of using your new approach, compare your time tracking results against your baseline:
   - **Time saved**: Do you notice that you’re spending less time on planning? Which tasks take less time?
   - **Quality of work**: Did simplifying your planning still allow you to create quality lessons? Did students get more out of each lesson?
   - **Overall satisfaction**: Are you feeling less stressed and more productive, or do you feel rushed? Are you maintaining a sustainable work-life balance?

### 5. **Adjust Based on Feedback**
   Consider your results and adjust your methods accordingly:
   - If you found you were spending more time on certain tasks (e.g., simplifying materials led to spending too much time refining them), tweak your approach to optimize the process.
   - If you noticed some areas where you could simplify even more (e.g., too many small coding exercises in your lessons), consider refining your use of the Pareto Principle.
   - If the Pomodoro Technique wasn’t helping with your planning (perhaps you need longer blocks of time for certain tasks), adjust the intervals (e.g., 45 minutes of work, 10 minutes of break) to better suit your style.

### 6. **Check Long-Term Effects**
   After using this approach for 4–6 weeks, determine how it's affecting both your schedule and the quality of your teaching:
   - **Time savings**: Do you feel like your planning is more efficient? Are you able to dedicate more time to other responsibilities (e.g., grading, student interaction)?
   - **Student outcomes**: Do your students better understand the material? Is their performance improving as a result of your focused and simpler lessons?
   - **Work-life balance**: Has this approach helped you reduce your workload and prevent burnout?
