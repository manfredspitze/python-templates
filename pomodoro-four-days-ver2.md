### Explanation:
- Each day includes **3 Pomodoros** (75 minutes total), which is your available planning time.
- **Pomodoros are distributed across the days** to keep you focused on core lesson planning (e.g., objectives, activities) early in the week and secondary tasks (e.g., materials, revisions) later in the week.
- **Breaks** are built in after each Pomodoro (5 minutes), helping you stay focused and refreshed.
- **Wednesday and Thursday** focus on **review, revision, and preparation** for future lessons to ensure you're staying ahead in your planning.

By spreading the work out this way, you balance intensity with rest, and you also allow yourself time to adjust and reflect on your progress as you move through the week.
