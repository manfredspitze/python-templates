The 80/20 rule, or Pareto Principle, suggests that 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. Here are some practical ways to apply this to your lesson planning:

1. Identify Key Learning Objectives: Focus on the 20% of content that will deliver 80% of the learning outcomes. Prioritize the most important concepts and skills that students need to master.

2. Reuse and Adapt Materials: Instead of creating new materials from scratch each time, reuse and adapt existing resources. This could include lesson plans, worksheets, and activities that have worked well in the past.

3. Streamline Activities: Choose activities that are high-impact and engaging but don't require excessive preparation. For example, group discussions, peer teaching, and project-based learning can be very effective without needing extensive prep time.

4. Take Advantage of Technology: Use educational technology tools to automate and simplify parts of your planning. Tools like Google Classroom, Kahoot, or Quizlet can save time and enhance student engagement.

5. Focus on Feedback: Spend more time on providing meaningful feedback rather than on creating elaborate lesson plans. Feedback is crucial for student improvement and can be more beneficial than the lesson itself.

6. Set Time Limits: Allocate a specific amount of time for lesson planning and stick to it. This can help you focus on the most important tasks and avoid getting bogged down in details.
