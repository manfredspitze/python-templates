### Coding Tasks

- Use comments to label each task in your script
  - Example: # Part 1, # Part 2, etc.
- Use f-strings to display the output for each task

#### Task 1

A store is offering a 20% discount on all items. If a shirt originally costs $30, what is the discounted price?

Use the IPO model to organize the code in your script.

#### Task 2

A rectangular garden has a length of 12 meters and a width of 8 meters. What is the area of the garden?

#### Task 3

A scientist is studying bacteria that double in number every hour. If there are initially 10 bacteria, how many bacteria will there be after 5 hours?

HINT: You'll need three variables to perform the calculation -- one for the beginning number of bacteria, another for the number of hours, and a third for the final number of bacteria.

You'll also use the exponent operator in this problem.

#### Task 4

Owen, Koen, and Qwynn are planning a road trip to Wisconsin.  

Write a script that will help them calculate the time it will take to drive 200 kilometers at 90 kilometers per hour.

#### Task 5
